Hacking on Network Logger
-------------------------

The Network Logger source tree is available from Google Code svn
(http://network-logger.googlecode.com/svn).

If you plan to hack on Network Logger, please make sure you work from the SVN
version. The SVN version can be checked from the Google Code svn server.

If you want to contribute in development discussions, please visit
http://groups.google.com/group/network-logger or send mail to the
Network Logger mailing list: <network-logger@googlegroups.com>.


Submitting Patches
------------------

If you've been working on a change to Network Logger and want to propose it for
inclusion, you have to generate a patch and submit it for review by the
maintainers.

Patches should be made with 'svn diff --diff-cmd diff -x -up >patch' and should
conform to Network Logger coding style as described in (no file yet, sorry).

The best way to submit a patch for review is to post it on the mailing list.
That way everyone sees it and can take part in the following discussion about
it. Sometimes people also attach patches to issues in
http://code.google.com/p/network-logger/issues. If you do this, please send a
mail to the list saying you did so.

If you're planning to do large changes, please take them up for discussion on
the list first. If you get feedback early it is much easier to integrate it into
your work.
