If you want to contribute in development discussions, please visit
http://groups.google.com/group/network-traffic or send mail to the
Network Traffic mailing list: <network-traffic@googlegroups.com>.


Submitting Patches
------------------

If you've been working on a change to Network Traffic and want to propose it for
inclusion, you have to generate a patch and submit it for review by the
maintainers.

Patches should be made with 'git format-patch -M' and should conform to Network
Traffic coding style as described in (no file yet, sorry).

The best way to submit a patch for review is to post it on the mailing list.
That way everyone sees it and can take part in the following discussion about
it. Sometimes people also attach patches to issues in
http://github.com/skarllot/network-traffic/issues. If you do this, please send a
mail to the list saying you did so.

If you're planning to do large changes, please take them up for discussion on
the list first. If you get feedback early it is much easier to integrate it into
your work.
